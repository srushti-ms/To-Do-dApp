Features
Decentralized ToDo List: Store tasks on the Aelf blockchain, ensuring data integrity and no central point of failure.
Portkey Wallet Integration: Seamless authentication and transaction signing using the Portkey wallet.
Smart Contract Management: All tasks are managed via Aelf smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent task management.
User-Friendly Interface: A modern, responsive interface to easily interact with the blockchain-based ToDo list.
Privacy & Security: All interactions are secured through blockchain technology, ensuring that your tasks remain private and immutable.
